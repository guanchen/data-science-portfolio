# Data Science Portfolio
Portfolio of Data Analysis Projects, I have worked for learning and academic purposes. I have been working on different datasets like Kaggle's lottery dataset, freeCodeCamp, and ...
## Contents
* **Data Cleaning and Analysis**
  * [Star Wars Survey](star-war-survey): Performed data cleaning on movie reviews to analyze the reliability of the positive and negative reviews and specify the reviews by different identities.
  * [Employee Exit Survey](employee-exit-survey): Perform data cleaning and analyze on Australian government-provided datasets to figure out the reasons why the former employees exit and what are the dissatisfications between younger and older employees.

* **Data Visualization**
  * [Visualizing Earning Based On College Majors](NYC-high-schools): Visualized how majors affect the earnings of a graduate.

* **Probability and Statistics**
  * [Mobile App for Lottery Addicts](mobile-app-for-lottery-addicts): Contributed to a mobile app to prevent and treat lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning.
  * [building a Spam Filter with Naive Bayes](building-a-spam-filter): Built a spam filter on SMS messages using multinomial naive bayes algorithm with accuracy of 98.74% on the test set I used.
  
* **Significance Tesing**
  * [Winning jeopary](winning-jeopary): Text analysis while figuring out strategies to win the Quiz TV show -- Jeopardy, and the chi-squared test was applied in particular.

* **Machine Learning**
  * [Predicting car price using k-nearst neighborhood algorithm](car-price-prediction-knn): Practiced machine learning workflow using k-nearest neighbors to predict car prices. The process involved Data cleaning, Univariate modle, Multivariate model and hyperparameter tuning.
